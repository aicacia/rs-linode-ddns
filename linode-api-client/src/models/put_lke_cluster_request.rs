When upgrading the Kubernetes version, only the next latest minor version following the current version can be deployed.

Labels have the following constraints:    - UTF-8 characters will be returned by the API using escape sequences of their Unicode code points. For example, the Japanese character _„Åã_ is 3 bytes in UTF-8 (`0xE382AB`). Its Unicode code point is 2 bytes (`0x30AB`). APIv4 supports this character and the API will return it as the escape sequence using six 1 byte characters which represent 2 bytes of Unicode code point (`\"\\u30ab\"`).    - 4 byte UTF-8 characters are not supported.    - If the label is entirely composed of UTF-8 characters, the API response will return the code points using up to 193 1 byte characters.
