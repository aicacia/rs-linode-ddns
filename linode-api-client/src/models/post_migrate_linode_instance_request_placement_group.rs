/// PostMigrateLinodeInstanceRequestPlacementGroup : Include this to assign this Linode to an existing [placement group](https://www.linode.com/docs/products/compute/compute-instances/guides/placement-groups/) in the data center you're migrating to. These constraints apply:  - If the target Linode is in a placement group, it will be removed from it when migrating. - The target placement group needs to be in the same `region` you're migrating to. - The target placement group needs to have capacity. Run the [Get a region](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-region) operation for the region you want to migrate to, and store the `maximum_linodes_per_pg` value. Run the [Get a placement group](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/get-placement-group) operation for that same region to review how many Linodes are in that group.
