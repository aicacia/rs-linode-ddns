/// GetLinodeConfig200ResponseInterfacesInnerIpv4Nat11 : The 1:1 NAT IPv4 address, used to associate a public IPv4 address with the interface's VPC subnet IPv4 address.  - Only supported for interfaces with a `purpose` of `vpc`.  - Returned as `null` if no 1:1 NAT is set for a `vpc` type interface.  - Returned as an empty string (`\"\"`) for non-`vpc` type interfaces.  When included in a request:  - You can set this to a specific, public IPv4 address that's available on the Linode. You can also use the `any` keyword to enable the Linode's assigned public IPv4 address.  - A specified address can't be shared with another Linode.  - Omit this object or include it and set it to `null` or an empty string (`\"\"`) to block creation of a 1:1 NAT.  <<LB>>  > ðŸ“˜ > > You can't set this to a specific IPv4 address when creating a new Linode. During the creation process, the network automatically establishes a public IPv4 address for the Linode. Since this address doesn't exist yet, you can't include a custom IPv4 address to change it. After your Linode is created, you can [update your configuration profile interface](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/linode-instances/#configuration-profile-interface-update) to change the `nat_1_1` address.
