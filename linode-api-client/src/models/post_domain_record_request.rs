Wildcard NS records (`*`) are not supported.  `MX`: The mail subdomain. For example, `sub` for the address `user@sub.example.com` under the `example.com` Domain.  - The left-most subdomain component may be an asterisk (`*`) to designate a wildcard subdomain. - Other subdomain components must only contain letters, digits, and hyphens, start with a letter, end with a letter or digit, and contain less than 64 characters. - Must be an empty string (`\"\"`) for a Null MX Record.  `CNAME`: The hostname. Must be unique. Required.  `TXT`: The hostname.  `SRV`: Unused. Use the `service` property to set the service name for this record.  `CAA`: The subdomain. Omit or enter an empty string (`\"\"`) to apply to the entire Domain.  `PTR`: See our guide on how to [Configure Your Linode for Reverse DNS (rDNS)](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/configure-rdns/).

For requests, this property's actual usage and whether it is required depends on the type of record this represents:  `A` and `AAAA`: The IP address. Use `[remote_addr]` to submit the IPv4 address of the request. Required.  `NS`: The name server. Must be a valid domain. Required.  `MX`: The mail server. Must be a valid domain unless creating a Null MX Record. Required.  - Must have less than 254 total characters. - The left-most domain component may be an asterisk (`*`) to designate a wildcard domain. - Other domain components must only contain letters, digits, and hyphens, start with a letter, end with a letter or digit, and contain less than 64 characters. - To create a [Null MX Record](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7505), first [remove](https://techdocs.akamai.com/linode-api/reference/delete-domain-record) any additional MX records, then create an MX record with empty strings (`\"\"`) for the `target` and `name`. If a Domain has a Null MX record, new MX records cannot be created.  `CNAME`: The alias. Must be a valid domain. Required.  `TXT`: The value. Required.  `SRV`: The target domain or subdomain. If a subdomain is entered, it is automatically used with the Domain. To configure for a different domain, enter a valid FQDN. For example, the value `www` with a Domain for `example.com` results in a target set to `www.example.com`, whereas the value `sample.com` results in a target set to `sample.com`. Required.  `CAA`: The value. For `issue` or `issuewild` tags, the domain of your certificate issuer. For the `iodef` tag, a contact or submission URL (domain, http, https, or mailto). Requirements depend on the tag for this record:    - `issue`: The domain of your certificate issuer. Must include a valid domain. May include additional parameters separated with semicolons (`;`), for example: `www.example.com; foo=bar`   - `issuewild`: The domain of your wildcard certificate issuer. Must be a valid domain and must not start with an asterisk (`*`).   - `iodef`: Must be either (1) a valid domain, (2) a valid domain prepended with `http://` or `https://`, or (3) a valid email address prepended with `mailto:`.  `PTR`: Required. See our guide on how to [Configure Your Linode for Reverse DNS (rDNS)](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/configure-rdns/).  With the exception of A, AAAA, and CAA records, this field accepts a trailing period.
