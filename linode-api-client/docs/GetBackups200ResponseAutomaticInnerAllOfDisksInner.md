**filesystem** | Option<**String**> | The disk's format or file system. A value of `raw` indicates no file system, just a raw binary stream. A value of `swap` indicates a Linux swap area. The values `ext3` or `ext4` represent these Linux journaling file systems. The value `ext2` is the deprecated ext2 Linux file system. Finally, `initrd` indicates the disk is formatted as an uncompressed initial RAM disk.  > ðŸ“˜ > > The `ext2` file system doesn't properly support timestamps and will be removed from Linux support in the near future. Also, `initrd` is a legacy format that no longer applies to most use cases. As a best practice, use the other supported formats or file systems instead. | [optional]
